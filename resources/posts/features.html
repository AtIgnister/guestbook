<h1>Why guestbooks.kamiscorner.xyz?</h1>
<p>You might be asking yourself: "Kami, why are you doing another guestbook service? aren't there enough of those already?"</p>
<p>Well... Because I don't like any of the other ones.</p>
<p>Every other guestbook I've seen has at least one of these anti-features:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Is self-hosted and takes a ton of setup</li>
    <li>Is paid, and costs an absurd amount of money for the functionality provided</li>
    <li>Is free, but only has very basic features</li>
    <li>Doesn't care about your privacy</li>
    <li>Doesn't allow you to export your data</li>
    <li>Is at the complete whims of one person/a small team/a company, with no way to self-host or fork the project</li>
</ul>
<p>So, I made this place, to hopefully remedy that!</p>
<br>
<p>Here are the features:</p>
<br>
<p>1. It is really difficult for you to lose all your data (Assuming you don't actively sabotage yourself)</p>
<p>I accomplish this by letting you export your data in every format you would reasonably want to export it. (JSON, CSV and HTML).</p>
<p>Additionally, automatic exports by email and webmention support is planned, to make it basically impossible for anyone to lose all of their guestbook data, even if this website goes down permanently at some point.</p>
<br>
<p>2. It's reasonably privacy conscious</p>
<p>Guestbook entries are not directly associated with any personal data. I can't trace back any entries to one specific IP or person.</p>
<p>The source code is also public, letting you double-check whether or not I'm actually telling the truth here.</p>
<br>
<p>You can also delete either your entire account, or any individual guestbooks you create, and all associated data will be deleted permanently.</p>
<p>(Technically, it would be possible for me to use software like SysTools SQLite to recover deleted data, but this only works for a fairly short period of time before said data is overwritten, and any recovered data would likely be incomplete.)</p>
<br>
<p>3. You can self-host it</p>
<p>Do you not feel comfortable trusting me with hosting your guestbook?</p>
<p>Fair enough! This project is licensed under GPLv3, meaning that you can do pretty much anything you want with it! (Apart from making it closed source)</p>
<p>So, go forth and self-host! Add your own features! File off the serial numbers! Charge people money for it if you really want to! The world is your oyster!</p>
<br>
<p>4. It's customizable</p>
<p>Everyone gets to customize their guestbooks CSS (and, of course, the name)</p>
<p>Also, you get up to 5 different guestbooks. Which, i feel, should reasonably be enough for anyones guestbook-ing needs.</p>
<br>
<p>Also, the UI looks similiar to <a href="https://bearblog.dev">a blogging service you may or may not already be using.</a></p>
<br>
<p>So, if you're on there, it'll integrate quite nicely into the rest of your site.</p>
