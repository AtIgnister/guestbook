<h1>Commenting Guidelines</h1>
<p>Heya!</p>
<p>Before you comment, here's some rules to follow to ensure guestbooks continues being an enjoyable website to use.</p>
<br>
<p>These rules apply site-wide, so no matter whose guestbook you're using, if you break one, I will delete your message. (and, depending on the infraction, IP ban you)</p>
<br>
<p>Here they are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>No racism/ableism/transpobia/homophobia etc.</li>
    <li>Don't post anything that could get me in trouble. (links to pirated content, recordings of real-life violence, etc.)</li>
    <li>No spam or phishing scams.</li>
    <li>Don't encourage self-harm.</li>
    <li>Keep things SFW.</li>
    <li>Don't dox yourself/anyone else. I will delete your message if you share your phone number or adress.</li>
</ul>
<p>These obviously also go for the owners of the guestbooks. If you post anything on your own guestbook that violates these rules, I will either edit your message to remove the infringing content (if i see you accidentally doxxing yourself) or delete your account. (which will also automatically delete any guestbooks you're created)</p>
<br>
<p>I may add to these rules as we go, but in general: Just be reasonable. I try to interpret messages charitably. If you use guestbooks for their intended purpose of giving feedback or reaching out and initiating a conversation, you will never get your account banned.</p>
<br>
<p>I try to only act when it is very clear that someone is doing stuff that is blatantly against the rules. Guestbook owners have their own moderation tools, so if it won't get the site in trouble or is blatant hatespeech, I'll leave it up to them.</p>
