                <p>This is required in order to let you log in and create guestbooks that get associated with your account.</p>
                <p>If you enable two-factor authentication (2FA), a secret key is stored with your account to allow secure login using a TOTP-supported application on your phone or desktop. This information is used solely for authentication and is not shared with third parties.</p>
            </li>
            <li>

                <strong>The content of all guestbook entries you create.</strong>
                <p>These are shown publicly.</p> 
                <p>Guestbook entries are not linked to user accounts or stored with identifying information such as user IDs or IP addresses.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Your session data: Your session data is valid for a total of 2 hours. Sending new requests resets this timer.</strong>
                <p>Your session data includes your IP, your user id (if you have an account and are currently logged in), your browsers user agent, and the last time you interacted with the website.</p>
                <p>A session cookie is also saved on your browser. Your session is <b>not</b> associated with any guestbook entries you create.</p>
                <p>Your session information is used in order to determine if the browser you are using is currently logged into the website, and to be able to persist your logged in status even when you close and reopen the browser.</p>
                <p>Expired sessions are automatically ignored and periodically removed.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        
        <h2>Where is the server located?</h2>
        <p>This website is hosted on servers located in the European Union.</p>

        <h2>How do I use your data?</h2>
        <p>I use your login info to let you log in and create new guestbooks, I use the data you enter into the guestbook creation form to create new guestbooks that are tied to your account, I use your session data to keep track of your login status, I use the data you enter into the guestbook entry creation form 
            to create anonymous guestbook entries.
        </p>

        <h2>Your rights</h2>
        <p>When interacting with this website, you have these rights:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> Request a copy of your data. You can do this from the dashboard by pressing the "download complete user data backup" button. TODO: implement this</li>
            <li><strong>Correction:</strong> Update incorrect data. You can edit all of your account and guestbook info at any time using the dashboard.</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Request account deletion. This is possible using the dashboard, by pressing the delete account button. This will delete any data that is associated with your account. Because guestbook entries are anonymous and not linked to accounts, I cannot verify authorship. However, if an entry contains personal information, you may request its removal.</li>
            <li><strong>Restriction & Objection:</strong> Ask guestbooks.kamiscorner.xyz to limit how your data is used.</li>
            <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Request your data in a portable format. This website currently offers JSON, CSV and HTML exports, which are all accessible from your dashboard. If you want to export your data in a format that currently isn't offered, you can email me at kami@kamiscorner.xyz, and I may manually export it for you or add another export type. Exported data does not include your password in a usable form.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Account deletion:</h2>
        <p>Deleting your account will delete all data I have that can be associated with your account. This consists of: Your account info (name, email, etc.) and all data about any guestbooks you have created.</p>
    
        <h2>Security:</h2>
        <p>I take reasonable measures to keep this website secure, but no system is perfect. Use a strong password and practice online safety. I strongly discourage you from posting any personably identifiable information in the guestbook entries or guestbooks you create.</p>
        <p>If you want to check the security of this website for yourself, you can inspect the source code over at <a href="https://github.com/atignister/guestbook">Github.</a></p>
        <p>If you have any security concerns, or find a vulnerability, please email me about it.</p>

        <h2>Changes to this policy:</h2>
        <p>If this policy changes, you will be notified the next time you open this website. This website also has a <a href="">separate page</a> (TODO: implement this) as well as an RSS-Feed that keeps track of all policy updates which you can follow with a feed reader of your choice. If you have an account with a valid email, I will also send you an email whenever the policy changes. The email server this website uses is self-hosted to minimize the data that gets shared with third-parties. Due to this, the emails that get sent may end up in your spam-folder. To prevent this, you may want to consider explicitly whitelisting guestbooks@kamiscorner.xyz in your email client.</p>

        <h2>Contact:</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions, you can contact me at kami@kamiscorner.xyz.</p>
